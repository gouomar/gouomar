## Hello, I'm Omar.

I build tools that eliminate repetitive work. My focus is on identifying friction points and shipping solutions that give people their time back because time spent explaining the same thing twice is time wasted.

My foundation in **C programming** taught me to think at the system level *(and gave me trust issues with memory management)*, while **Python and AI** give me the leverage to solve problems at scale.

### My Projects

I believe in solving real problems for real people. Here's what I've built.

#### 🤖 [Ba3bou3](https://www.ba3bou3.me/)   AI Assistant for 1337 Students

**The Problem:**  
Every 1337 student faces the same struggle explaining the Norm, the Heart System, peer corrections, and Common Core rules over and over. Seniors repeat themselves. New students stay confused. And somewhere, a bocal member sighs for the 47th time today.

**The Solution:**  
I built Ba3bou3, an AI assistant powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** that knows 1337's rules inside out. It retrieves accurate answers from a custom knowledge base and responds instantly no more waiting for someone to be free, no more "bro just read the PDF."

**The Stack:**  
`Next.js` · `TypeScript` · `Gemini 2.5 Flash` · `Pinecone Vector DB` · `RAG Architecture`

**The Result:**  
→ Instant answers to questions that used to take 10+ minutes to explain  
→ 24/7 availability (yes, even at 3AM when you're debugging and questioning your life choices)  
→ Built by students, for the 1337 struggle
