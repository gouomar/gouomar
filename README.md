## Hello, I'm Omar.

I build tools that eliminate repetitive work. My focus is on identifying friction points and shipping solutions that give people their time back—because time spent explaining the same thing twice is time wasted.

My foundation in **C programming** taught me to think at the system level, while **Python and AI** give me the leverage to solve problems at scale.

### My Projects

I believe in solving real problems for real people. Here's what I've built.

#### 🤖 [Ba3bou3](https://www.ba3bou3.me/) — AI Assistant for 1337 Students

**The Problem:**  
Every 1337 student faces the same struggle—explaining the Norm, the Heart System, peer corrections, and Common Core rules over and over. Seniors repeat themselves. New students stay confused. Hours are lost.

**The Solution:**  
I built Ba3bou3, an AI assistant powered by **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** that knows 1337's rules inside out. It retrieves accurate answers from a custom knowledge base and responds instantly—no more waiting for someone to be free.

**The Stack:**  
`Next.js` · `TypeScript` · `Gemini 2.5 Flash` · `Pinecone Vector DB` · `RAG Architecture`

**The Result:**  
→ Instant answers to questions that used to take 10+ minutes to explain  
→ 24/7 availability (even during lunch breaks)  
→ Built by students, for the 1337 struggle

### What I'm About

- 🎯 **Solving problems, not writing code for its own sake.** The best solution is the one that works.
- ⚡ **Automation over repetition.** If I have to do something twice, I'll build a tool.
- 🧠 **Learning in public.** I share what I build so others can learn too.

*Keep coding. Greatness awaits.*
