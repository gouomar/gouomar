## Hello, I'm Omar.

I build tools that eliminate repetitive work. My focus is on identifying friction points and shipping solutions that give people their time back because time spent explaining the same thing twice is time wasted.

My foundation in **C programming** taught me to think at the system level *(and gave me trust issues with memory management)*, while **Python and AI** give me the leverage to solve problems at scale.
